# airline_EDA
5/30/2017

This is the first part of a project using airline departure data from the American Statistical Association. It is mostly done using exploratory data analysis using Python and Pandas library. The project will continue to advance as I get more time to continue the project (while also getting better at python!).

Thanks.
Anthony
